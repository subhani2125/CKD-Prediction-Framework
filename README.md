# CKD-Prediction-Framework
 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction Framework This repository contains a comprehensive framework for analyzing and predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The project employs both manual and automated feature extraction methods to enhance model performance and achieve high accuracy in classification tasks.  Key Features Dataset Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding to prepare data for analysis. Feature Engineering: Includes manual feature extraction (custom rules) and automated feature expansion (polynomial features). Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Evaluation Metrics: Measures model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance comparison. Clustering Analysis: Includes unsupervised learning techniques such as KMeans and DBSCAN for exploratory data analysis. Repository Structure Data: Contains the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset and processed files. Notebooks: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks with code and visualizations. Reports: Detailed report summarizing preprocessing, feature engineering, model performance, and conclusions. Scripts: Python scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
